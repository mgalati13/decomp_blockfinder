NOTE: Data file LIB.MODGLOB.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the 
      session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and 
      might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem MODGLOB has 422 variables (98 binary, 0 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 291 constraints (196 LE, 95 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 968 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 68 variables and 5 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 76 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 0 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 354 variables, 286 constraints, and 892 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP solver is called.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is used.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is executing in single-machine mode.
NOTE: The DECOMP method value AUTO is applied.
NOTE: The automated method will attempt to find block-angular form with 2 blocks.
NOTE: The problem has a decomposable structure with 5 blocks. The largest block covers 49.65% of the constraints in the 
      problem.
NOTE: The decomposition subproblems cover 354 (100%) variables and 280 (97.9%) constraints.
NOTE: The deterministic parallel mode is enabled.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is using up to 4 threads.
