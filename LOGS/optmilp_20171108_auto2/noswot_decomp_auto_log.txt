NOTE: Data file LIB.NOSWOT.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the 
      session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and 
      might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem noswot has 128 variables (75 binary, 25 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 182 constraints (54 LE, 2 EQ, 126 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 735 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 8 variables and 11 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 55 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 143 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 120 variables, 171 constraints, and 680 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP solver is called.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is used.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is executing in single-machine mode.
NOTE: The DECOMP method value AUTO is applied.
NOTE: The automated method will attempt to find block-angular form with 2 blocks.
NOTE: The stretched problem has 128 variables, 179 constraints, and 696 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The problem has a decomposable structure with 7 blocks. The largest block covers 18.44% of the constraints in the 
      problem.
