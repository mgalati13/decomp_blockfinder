NOTE: Data file LIB.SET1CH.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the 
      session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and 
      might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem SET1CH has 712 variables (240 binary, 0 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 492 constraints (252 LE, 240 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 1412 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 69 variables and 69 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 157 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 0 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 643 variables, 423 constraints, and 1255 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP solver is called.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is used.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is executing in single-machine mode.
NOTE: The DECOMP method value AUTO is applied.
NOTE: The automated method will attempt to find block-angular form with 4 blocks.
NOTE: The problem has a decomposable structure with 20 blocks. The largest block covers 5.201% of the constraints in 
      the problem.
NOTE: The decomposition subproblems cover 632 (98.29%) variables and 412 (97.4%) constraints.
NOTE: The deterministic parallel mode is enabled.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is using up to 4 threads.
