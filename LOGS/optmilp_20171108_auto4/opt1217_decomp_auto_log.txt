NOTE: Data file LIB.OPT1217.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the 
      session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and 
      might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem opt1217 has 769 variables (768 binary, 0 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 64 constraints (0 LE, 48 EQ, 16 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 1542 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 10 variables and 0 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 10 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 0 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 759 variables, 64 constraints, and 1532 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP solver is called.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is used.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is executing in single-machine mode.
NOTE: The DECOMP method value AUTO is applied.
WARNING: The Decomposition algorithm was not run because the automated method was unable to find block-angular form.
NOTE: The Branch and Cut algorithm is used.
