NOTE: Data file LIB.MINE_166_5.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match 
      the session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources 
      and might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem mine-166-5 has 830 variables (830 binary, 0 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 8429 constraints (8429 LE, 0 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 19412 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 117 variables and 1700 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 3814 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver added 20 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 62 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 713 variables, 6729 constraints, and 15598 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP solver is called.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is used.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is executing in single-machine mode.
NOTE: The DECOMP method value AUTO is applied.
WARNING: The Decomposition algorithm was not run because the automated method was unable to find block-angular form.
NOTE: The Branch and Cut algorithm is used.
