NOTE: Data file LIB.P2756.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the 
      session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and 
      might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem P2756 has 2756 variables (2756 binary, 0 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 755 constraints (755 LE, 0 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 8937 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 331 variables and 255 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 3831 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 83 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 2425 variables, 500 constraints, and 5106 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP solver is called.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is used.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is executing in single-machine mode.
NOTE: The DECOMP method value AUTO is applied.
NOTE: The automated method will attempt to find block-angular form with 8 blocks.
NOTE: The problem has a decomposable structure with 151 blocks. The largest block covers 10.6% of the constraints in 
      the problem.
