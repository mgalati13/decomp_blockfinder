NOTE: Data file LIB.FIXNET6.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the 
      session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and 
      might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem FIXNET6 has 878 variables (378 binary, 0 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 478 constraints (378 LE, 100 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 1756 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 1 variables and 1 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 2 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 308 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 877 variables, 477 constraints, and 1754 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP solver is called.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is used.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is executing in single-machine mode.
NOTE: The DECOMP method value AUTO is applied.
NOTE: The automated method will attempt to find block-angular form with 8 blocks.
NOTE: The problem has a decomposable structure with 137 blocks. The largest block covers 5.241% of the constraints in 
      the problem.
NOTE: The decomposition subproblems cover 856 (97.61%) variables and 459 (96.23%) constraints.
NOTE: The deterministic parallel mode is enabled.
NOTE: The Decomposition algorithm is using up to 4 threads.
