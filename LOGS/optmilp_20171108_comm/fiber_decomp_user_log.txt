NOTE: Data file LIB.FIBER.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the 
      session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and 
      might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem FIBER has 1298 variables (1254 binary, 0 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 363 constraints (0 LE, 363 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 2944 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 252 variables and 73 constraints.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed 513 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The MILP presolver modified 14 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The presolved problem has 1046 variables, 290 constraints, and 2431 constraint coefficients.
