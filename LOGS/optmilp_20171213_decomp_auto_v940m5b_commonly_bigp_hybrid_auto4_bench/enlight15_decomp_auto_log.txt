NOTE: Data file LIB.ENLIGHT15.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match 
      the session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources 
      and might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem enlight15 has 450 variables (225 binary, 225 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 225 constraints (0 LE, 225 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 1290 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver removed all variables and constraints.
