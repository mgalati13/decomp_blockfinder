NOTE: Data file LIB.ENLIGHT9.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match 
      the session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources 
      and might reduce performance.
NOTE: The problem enlight9 has 162 variables (81 binary, 81 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 81 constraints (0 LE, 81 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 450 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: Constraint left_lower_co@4e causes the problem to be infeasible.
