NOTE: Data file LIB.ENLIGHT9.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and might reduce 
      performance.
NOTE: The problem enlight9 has 162 variables (81 binary, 81 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 81 constraints (0 LE, 81 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 450 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: Constraint left_lower_co@4e causes the problem to be infeasible.
NOTE: The MILP presolver found this problem to be infeasible.
