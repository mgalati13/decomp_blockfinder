NOTE: Data file LIB.ENLIGHT16.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and might reduce 
      performance.
NOTE: The problem enlight16 has 512 variables (256 binary, 256 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 256 constraints (0 LE, 256 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 1472 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: Constraint left_lower_co@fd causes the problem to be infeasible.
NOTE: The MILP presolver found this problem to be infeasible.
