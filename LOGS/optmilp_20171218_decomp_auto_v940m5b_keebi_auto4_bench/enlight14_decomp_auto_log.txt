NOTE: Data file LIB.ENLIGHT14.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the session encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and might reduce 
      performance.
NOTE: The problem enlight14 has 392 variables (196 binary, 196 integer, 0 free, 0 fixed).
NOTE: The problem has 196 constraints (0 LE, 196 EQ, 0 GE, 0 range).
NOTE: The problem has 1120 constraint coefficients.
NOTE: The initial MILP heuristics are applied.
NOTE: The MILP presolver value AUTOMATIC is applied.
NOTE: Constraint left_lower_co@c1 causes the problem to be infeasible.
